<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Biography</strong>: Rohan Padhye is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science, primarily affiliated with the Institute for Software Research. His research interests include dynamic program analysis and automated software testing. At CMU, he directs the Program Analysis, Software Testing, and Applications (PASTA) lab. Rohan obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where he was advised by Koushik Sen. In his dissertation, Rohan developed new abstractions and algorithms to enable software developers to specialize random fuzzing tools for domain-specific testing objectives.  Complementing his doctoral work, he collaborated with Microsoft Research and Samsung Research America, developing techniques to automatically find software bugs in large-scale production systems. He is the recipient of an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Artifact Award, an ACM SIGSOFT Tool Demonstration Award, an SOSP Best Paper Award, the C.V. Ramamoorthy Distinguished Research Award, and an Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award. He previously worked at IBM Research India and holds a master’s degree from the IIT Bombay.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summary of Research</strong>: Rohan Padhye's research focuses on developing algorithms and tools to automatically identify software bugs which do not surface during manual testing.   
He develops <em>lightweight automated testing</em> techniques using dynamic program analysis and random fuzzing. Although these approaches are well known, their effectiveness as push-button tools is limited to the availability of good test inputs or to discovering a narrow class of software faults. Rohan's research targets scenarios where the test program, the input format, and the testing objective becomes complex. In such settings, the traditional approach of analyzing or automatically testing a program in isolation either does not scale or produces inadequate results. A key insight of Rohan's research is that automated testing tools can be made smarter by drawing upon artifacts incorporating the domain expertise of software developers; thus, challenging testing problems can be made tractable. His solutions utilize a variety of data sources from existing unit tests to explicitly provided specifications. Rohan's research tools have helped uncover over a thousand new bugs—affecting correctness, reliability, security, and performance—across widely used open-source and commercial software that runs on billions of devices. Rohan's research has been applied across a variety of domains including mobile security systems, software-defined networking controllers, big-data analytics platforms, and distributed systems running asynchronous programs and microservices. Going forward, Rohan is interested in maximizing the scalability and applicability of these tools and techniques when the underlying software is continuously evolving.
